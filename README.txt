Jartin is an open source art generator, it uses the provided png brushes, or so called "stamps" to generate random abstract art.
Jartin is easy to use and does not require any configuration to get started.

Some examples of well done Jartin generated images:

If you are interested in becoming a Jartin developer, then please contact me at my Gmail "joonas.wali"
If jartin stamps contain any of your brushes and you are not happy that they are being used, then please let me know.

"mvn install" to build app.
target/stamps/stamps should then contain the fully compiled app. 
(Currently win executors only, you need to convert them to linux or OSX if needed, or just launch the jartin.jar file yourself.)
