Jartin is an open source abstract art generator, it uses user provided stencils to generate random abstract art.
Jartin is easy to use and does not require any configuration to get started.
User can easily add new stencils and stencil groups.

Some nice examples of Jartin generated images:

If jartin stamps contain any of your brushes and you are not happy that they are being used, then please let me know.

"mvn install" to build app.
target/stamps/stamps should then contain the fully compiled app. 
(Currently win executors only, you need to convert them to linux or OSX if needed, or just launch the jartin.jar file yourself.)
