# Jartin

Jartin is an open source abstract art generator, it uses user provided stencils to generate random abstract art.
Jartin is trivial to use and does not require any initial configuration to get started.

## Examples

Some nice examples of Jartin generated images:

## Getting Started

You can build the app by Maven: 
```
mvn package
```

target/stamps/stamps should then contain the fully compiled app. 
(Currently win executors only, you need to convert them to linux or OSX if needed, or just launch the jartin.jar file yourself.)

If jartin stamps contain any of your brushes and you are not happy that they are being used, then please let me know.
